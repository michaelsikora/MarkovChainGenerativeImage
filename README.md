Python program to generate an image from a Markov Chain Model

Each pixel's color is a state of a markov chain that only depends
on the current color of that pixel and the transition probability to the next state

The colors are in BGR

Environment: 
Python 3.7, Windows 10, PyCharm IDE

2020.03.30 code has been split into two seperate classes. one class for the color scheme markov chain, the second for the generative image
